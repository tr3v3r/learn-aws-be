# Expo Web vs Monorepo Approach Comparison
 
| Aspect                           | Expo Web (React Native Web via Expo)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Monorepo Approach (React JS and Expo)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code Reusability**             | **High (approximately 70-80%)**: Business logic, state management, data fetching, authentication flows, and UI components can be largely reused. Most components using Tamagui/React Native styling can be preserved. Platform-specific code can be handled with conditional rendering or platform files (.web.tsx). Some styling adjustments may be required for web-specific behavior.                    | **Low to Medium (approximately 20-30%)**: Would require significant rewrite of UI components from React Native to React DOM. Business logic, API integration, and state management code could be partially reused but would need adaptation. React Native specific components and navigation patterns would need complete reimplementation using web-equivalent libraries. |
| **Performance**                  | Larger JS bundles (~1.4MB, ~400KB gzipped). Some runtime overhead due to abstraction. Animations less smooth but improving (tree-shaking, static rendering in new SDKs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Smaller bundles (tens of KB gzipped). Faster loads with tree-shaking & code-splitting. Direct DOM manipulation, optimized rendering, smooth CSS animations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Developer Experience**         | Unified workflow for iOS, Android, Web. Easy setup with Expo CLI & Expo Go. Shared components across platforms. Some web styling limitations (no direct CSS/media queries). Debugging with browser devtools + Metro logs.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Web-first tooling (CRA, Next.js, Vite). Full CSS, media queries, browser APIs. More flexibility for web-specific features. Requires assembling libraries (routing, service workers).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Deployment & Build**           | Single build for all platforms. Outputs static files (HTML, JS, CSS). Can deploy to any CDN or Expo Hosting. Uses Metro bundler (with route-based splitting, PWA support). Limited SSR support.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Flexible: SPA, SSR, SSG with Next.js/Vite/Webpack. Deploy anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages). Full control over configs. Web-only targeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Ecosystem & Libraries**        | Access to React Native libraries (if web-compatible) + some web libraries. Not all RN modules work on web. Can embed raw DOM components (`use dom`). Growing ecosystem, but smaller than React web.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Huge ecosystem (Material-UI, Ant Design, etc.). Virtually all JS/web libraries available. Rich support for SEO, analytics, maps, editors, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Community & Docs**             | Active but smaller. Good Expo docs and forums. More focus on mobile than web, but improving. Web-specific support still niche.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | One of the largest dev communities. Extensive docs (react.dev, MDN). Countless tutorials, Q&A, frameworks with strong support (Next.js, CRA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Native Modules & Integration** | Mobile-first, strong native module support (camera, sensors, AR, etc.). Config Plugins and Modules API allow integration without ejecting. On web: limited to browser APIs (polyfills or fallbacks).                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Web-first. No access to native mobile APIs. Limited to browser capabilities (geolocation, camera, Bluetooth via Web APIs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Use Cases**                    | Best for cross-platform apps (one codebase for web + mobile). Ideal when mobile-first UI can adapt to web. Good for social apps, startups, internal tools. Less optimal if web is primary or requires heavy web-only features.                                                                                                                                                                              | Best for web-first apps where performance, SEO, and rich web features are critical (dashboards, marketing sites, enterprise apps). Not cross-platform. Requires separate mobile implementation if needed.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Testing**                      | Unit tests can be largely re-used between mobile and web. E2E testing requires careful tool selection as not all mobile testing tools support web (and vice versa). Tools like Detox may require platform-specific configurations. Consider Playwright or Cypress specifically for web testing within the Expo environment.                                                                                 | Web has a mature testing ecosystem. Unit tests with Jest/React Testing Library are standard. E2E testing with dedicated web tools like Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium provides comprehensive browser testing. Typically requires separate test suites from mobile implementations.                                                                                       |
| **Almeko SDK**                   | Fully compatible as the SDK is built with React Native Web. The same codebase can be used without modifications for both mobile and web implementations. Any required changes would only need to be done once and would be compiled for both platforms, ensuring consistent functionality across web and mobile.                                                                                            | Fully compatible with the same Almeko SDK used in the mobile implementation. Since the SDK is built with React Native Web, no separate integration is required. The unified codebase approach eliminates the need for platform-specific SDK adaptations.                                                                                                                   |
| **Team**                         | **Requires cross-platform expertise**: Developers need to understand both React Native concepts and web-specific behaviors. More effort is required from mobile developers to learn web platform nuances, accessibility concerns, and responsive design principles. Team members with primarily mobile experience will need additional training to efficiently work with web constraints and optimizations. | **Web-focused skillset**: Requires traditional web development skills without the overhead of learning React Native. Developers can use familiar web-only patterns and libraries. However, if mobile apps are also needed, this approach requires either maintaining two separate codebases or having distinct teams for web and mobile platforms.                         |

## Decision Summary: Key Considerations
 
When deciding between Expo Web (React Native Web) and a Monorepo approach, these core points should drive the decision:
 
### Performance
 
- **Expo Web**: Larger bundle sizes (~1.4MB, ~400KB gzipped) with some runtime overhead. Acceptable for most applications but may impact initial load times and performance on lower-end devices. Animations are less smooth but improving with newer SDK versions.
- **Monorepo**: Significantly better web performance with smaller bundles, efficient tree-shaking, code-splitting, and direct DOM manipulation. Delivers a more native web experience with smoother animations and faster load times.
 
### Team Requirements
 
- **Expo Web**: Requires developers with cross-platform expertise who understand both React Native concepts and web-specific behaviors. Mobile developers will need additional training on web platform nuances, accessibility, and responsive design.
- **Monorepo**: Allows for specialized teams - web developers can work with familiar web patterns and libraries, while mobile developers focus on native experiences. This approach may require larger teams or separate teams for web and mobile.
 
### Testing
 
- **Expo Web**: Enables significant test reuse between platforms, reducing overall testing effort. However, E2E testing requires careful tool selection as not all mobile testing tools support web. May need platform-specific configurations for comprehensive testing.
- **Monorepo**: Benefits from the mature web testing ecosystem with standard tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, and Playwright. However, requires completely separate test suites for web and mobile, increasing testing overhead.
 
### Recommendation
 
The decision should be based on:
 
1. **Team composition**: Consider your team's expertise and whether you have specialists in both web and mobile development
2. **Performance requirements**: Evaluate how critical web performance is for your application
3. **Development efficiency**: Balance code reuse benefits against platform-specific optimizations
4. **Long-term maintenance**: Consider the resources required to maintain either a unified codebase or separate codebases
 
### Input From Dev Side
 
**Given the Almeko SDK integration, Expo Web is the recommended option for this project.** Since most core business logic will be handled by the Almeko SDK (which is already built with React Native Web compatibility), the Expo Web approach provides significant advantages:
 
1. **Seamless SDK integration**: The Almeko SDK's full compatibility with React Native Web means no additional adaptation work is needed
2. **Consistent behavior**: Same SDK implementation across platforms ensures uniform functionality and reduces testing complexity
3. **Simplified maintenance**: Updates to the SDK only need to be integrated once rather than separately for web and mobile codebases
4. **Development efficiency**: The higher code reusability (70-80%) outweighs the performance trade-offs for this specific use case
5. **3rd Party Considerations**:
   - Many 3rd party React Native libraries may not be fully compatible with web, requiring fallbacks or alternative implementations
   - Web-specific 3rd party integrations (analytics, payment processors, etc.) may require platform-specific code or separate implementations
   - Cross-platform testing of 3rd party integrations adds complexity to the QA process
6. **Development Process Complexity**:
   - Cross-platform development requires additional effort for responsive design and platform-specific adaptations
   - Debugging is more complex when addressing issues that manifest differently across platforms
   - The build pipeline becomes more complex with the need to handle both native and web assets
   - Team members need broader expertise spanning both mobile and web development paradigms
   - Code reviews require consideration of both platforms, potentially slowing down the review process
 
While the Monorepo approach offers better web performance, the benefits of unified development and seamless SDK integration make Expo Web the more practical choice for this project's requirements despite the added complexity in handling 3rd party integrations and development processes.
